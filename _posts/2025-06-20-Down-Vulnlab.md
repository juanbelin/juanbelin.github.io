We start using `nmap` in order to know port and services running in the target and it reported us the port _22_ and _80_. We'll explore HTTP since we cannot do nothing with `ssh` for now.

In http this web exists which we can use to apparently make requests

After some tests, I can figured two things out. First as the image above, if you put two url, it will do a request to each url it receives, the other is that is probably using `curl`.

## Explotation 
So due to the way it's using curl, we can attemp to a SSRF:

Viewing `index.php` in order to get the webserver-code, we can see that a expert mode exists so lets see it.

In this new function, if we make a request to a unkown host we will get this error and searching in google we can confirm that is using `nc`

![](/assets/img/Anexos/Vulnlab-7.png)
So lets get a reverse shell:

In order to bypass this, lets use burp:

## Privilage Escalation

Once in, investigating the Aleks' home directory, there is a content apparently encrypted in `pswm`

![](/assets/img/Anexos/Vulnlab-12.png)

So I used this decryptor in order to find the master password and discover Aleks' password 

```shell
‚ùØ python3 pswm-decrypt.py -f code -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

[+] Master Password: flower
[+] Decrypted Data:
+------------+----------+----------------------+
| Alias      | Username | Password             |
+------------+----------+----------------------+
| pswm       | aleks    | flower               |
| aleks@down | aleks    | 1uY3w22uc-Wr{xNHR~+E |
+------------+----------+----------------------+
```

Once logged as _aleks_ we can execute whatever as whoever so lets get the root: 

```shell
aleks@down:~/.local/share/pswm$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for aleks: 
Matching Defaults entries for aleks on down:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin,
    use_pty

User aleks may run the following commands on down:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```
